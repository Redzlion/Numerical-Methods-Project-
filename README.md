# Numerical-Methods-Project-
Numerical Methods Project about Finding all roots of a polynomial

Program Description
Program consists of 2 files: findRoots.m and test.m. Code defines a function
in MATLAB called "findRoots" which takes a single input argument "w",
which is assumed to be a vector representing the coefficients of a
polynomial. The function finds the roots of the polynomial represented by
the input vector "w".
The function first calls another function called "findRootsPart" which is
defined within the function, passing it the input vector.
